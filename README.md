# Unit tests and integration test

The advantages of this proposal:

1. **Test Granularity**

   Unit tests focus on checking small parts of code, like functions or methods, in isolation. Integration tests, on the same page, look at how different parts of the program work together. Unit tests give you a close-up view, helping you find out what's causing problems and where to make fixes.

2. **Fast Feedback Loop**

   Unit tests are generally faster to execute compared to integration tests. Running a full suite of integration tests can take more time, which might slow down the feedback loop during development. When writing new code or refactoring, developers need rapid feedback to ensure they haven't introduced regressions.

   If there is a slow module used in some integration tests, it can slow down the entire test suite. Unit tests help avoid this problem by testing each module in isolation. This allows you to run the tests more frequently, ensuring that you get faster feedback.

3. **Isolation of Concerns**

   Unit tests allow you to isolate concerns and test individual pieces of code independently. This isolation makes it easier to understand which part of the codebase is causing issues, enabling quicker debugging and resolution.

   If we are using an integration test involving some different internal modules, it can be difficult to pinpoint the source of the problem. Unit tests help you avoid this problem by isolating the code under test.

4. **Maintainability and Refactoring**

   Unit tests provide a safety net when refactoring code. When you refactor or modify a specific function or module, unit tests help ensure that the behavior remains intact. They act as regression tests, catching potential bugs or regressions caused by changes.

   Using integration tests for this purpose can be more difficult, as they involve multiple components. If you refactor a function that is used by multiple modules, you might have to update all the integration tests that use that function. This can be time-consuming and error-prone.

5. **Testing Edge Cases**

   Unit tests make it easier to test edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional scenarios. Covering these scenarios is important to ensure your code handles a wide range of inputs and situations effectively.

   The code in the unit tests is bounded by the function or module being tested, making it easier to test edge cases specific to that function or module code. Integration tests, on the other hand, involve multiple components, making it more difficult to test edge cases (it's possible but the tests could be longer in code lines, more complex, and harder to maintain).

6. **Reducing Dependency on External Systems**

    Unit tests are like self-contained assessments for your code. They work independently and don't rely on external systems or services. This makes them flexible to run in different situations without extra setup. On the other hand, integration tests need more preparation and can be delicate due to relying on outside resources.

    Think of it this way: if something changes in an external system, it can cause integration tests to go wrong even if your actual code is fine. It's like having a correct answer, but the test still says it's wrong because of a problem outside your control. Fixing this issue might not involve changing your tested codeâ€”it's about getting the external system back on track. Until that happens, all integration tests related to that part will keep failing.

7. **Faster Debugging**

   When a test fails, unit tests allow you to narrow down the problem to the specific function or module being tested. This speeds up the debugging process compared to having to sift through the interactions of multiple components in an integration test.
